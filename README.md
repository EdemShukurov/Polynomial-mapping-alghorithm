# Polynomial-mapping-alghorithm

Given work simulates the communication between Alice and Bob to create public key and private one, that based on polynomial mappings.

This work contains 3 projets:
- "ConversationSimulation" It's graphic application written by WPF via VB.Net programming language. It used for UI part

- "Polynomial Mapping" It's project to create the cryptokeys. It's written by F# programming language.

- "Miller-Rabin Test" It's project, that contains the checking whether a number is simple or complex via the Miller-Rabin test. 
It also contains Unit-test for Miller-Rabin Test :)
